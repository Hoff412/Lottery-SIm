<h1>Lottery Simulator</h1>
A simple Python script for simulating lottery draws and checking if user-selected numbers match the winning combination.

<h2>How it Works</h2>

<h3>User Input:</h3>

Users are prompted to select six unique numbers between 1 and 53.
<h3>Validation:</h3>

Input is validated to ensure it's a number within the specified range and not a duplicate.
<h3>Simulation:</h3>

The program generates random winning numbers until the user's selected numbers match the winning combination.
<h3>Results:</h3>  

The program displays the winning combination, the number of drawings it took to win, and the estimated time to win based on two drawings per week.
<p><i><b>Note:</b> This simulation can take hours to complete due to the number of print statements. It is reccomended to run through a command line(CMD) as it will be much faster than using IDLE shell. You could also alter the code to run a set number of drawings instead of drawing until there is a winner, or remove the print statements for each drawing, and only have it print the final drawing.</i></p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
Run the script in a Python environment.
Enter six unique numbers when prompted.
